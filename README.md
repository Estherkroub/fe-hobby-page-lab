# Build a Passion Page

At Upperline, we believe that the best way to get good at Web Development is to **build things that matter to you.** For today's mini-project, you'll be working on a webpage that provides information, images, and links about something you're passionate about.

Paintball? Civics? 19th Century Art? Taylor Swift? You Choose!

## Instructions

+ You don't need to fork and clone this lab.
+ In your command line, `cd` to your main workspace, and create a new folder (using `mkdir`) with the name of your topic. Then `cd` into that directory.
+ Create a new index (home) page called `index.html` and open it up in the text editor.
+ Add in the HTML structure:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

+ Start building out your webpage! We'll come back to it as you learn more, but start adding in `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>` tags, and any others you want to experiment with!
